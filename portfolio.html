				Mozart Flute Concerto no. 1 in G Major, performed with orchestra in 2022.
				<br>
				<br>
				I had played in several orchestras throughout high school. While the piano is a more lonely instrument, 
				the flute has given me the unique excitement from playing in an ensemble. 
				This was the first time I performed as a soloist with an orchestra, and it was quite nerve-wracking to 
				perform this cadenza (written by the incredible flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal) in front of both the orchestra and 
				the audience. But once the strings faded and the moment of the cadenza arrived, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. 
				I hope you enjoy listening!

				Liszt's "Un Sospiro" from Three Concert Ã‰tudes.
				<br>
				<br>
				One of the last pieces I learned with my piano teacher before her sudden passing, this etude is quite special to me.
				"Un Sospiro", or "A Sigh", sounds to me like flowing water and ebbs between serenity and passion and stillness.
				During my time in college, I have strived to always keep music in my life, through performing in Chamber Music ensembles,
				taking classes, and slipping into the piano practice rooms between class. There have been many ebbs and flows of stillness and 
				frenzy these past few years, but the piano will always be a place I can come back to in order to clear my mind.

					Waltz, inspired by Ocean Vuong's "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous".
					<br>
					<br>
					I composed this short piece after reading Vuong's novel. It was my first official foray into composition, 
					and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of tinkering with a theme and spinning it into a full idea.
					I chose F minor for the piece's key for its association with melancholy, and because the key allows for a balance 
					between both white and black keys on the piano. What do you think of when you hear this piece? Does it 
					remind you of any mood, weather, memory?
